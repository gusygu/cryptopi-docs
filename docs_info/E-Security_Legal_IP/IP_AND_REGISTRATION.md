IP_AND_REGISTRATION.md
1. What Constitutes IP

Source code, DDL, architecture.

Matrices/mood logic, vector math.

Documentation sets and whitepapers.

UX patterns and design system.

2. Evidence Packs

For every tagged version:

Git Tag — e.g., v0.1.1.

VERSION & SOURCE_TAG files.

HASHES.sha256.txt for docs + selected code.

Source Snapshot (.zip or .tar.gz).

Public Mirror (optional but recommended).

3. INPI / National Registration Flow

Prepare docs + code snapshot.

Generate SHA256 hash.

Store snapshot in offline + encrypted storage.

Use INPI platform to file software registration.

Submit hash + description.

Maintain tracking in private IP_LOG.md.

4. Public vs Private Surfaces

Public: high-level docs, conceptual materials.

Private: full code, strategies, proprietary math.

5. Multi-Project Strategy

If linked to guest.inc or Gaia:

Each project forms a "node" with its own tags/hashes.

Maintain parent index linking nodes.
