What Is Mood?

The mood system reflects the aggregated stability of the user’s universe.

It is a tiered metric built from matrices, windows, and symbol-level behavior.

Components
1. Symbol Contribution

Every symbol provides:

pct24h signal

relative benchmark delta

structural vector changes

2. Thresholds

Mood tiers are determined by multilayer thresholds.

Examples:

Stable: narrow pct24h bands

Neutral: average microstructure stress

Distressed: negative clusters or large deviations

3. Tier Types

Global Tier: whole‑portfolio tier

Symbol Sub‑tiers: per-symbol event stress

Microstructure Tier: window and vector stability

How Mood Is Computed

Matrices produce pct24h + derived fields.

Str-Aux windows inform microstructure.

Weighted aggregation across enabled universe.

Threshold mapping → tier.

Why It Exists

Mood gives users a single glance indicator of market conditions relative to their universe.
