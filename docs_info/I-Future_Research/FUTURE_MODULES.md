Purpose

A roadmap of potential add‑ons that extend CryptoPill beyond the current architecture.

1. Toxicology Module

Inspired by user research on xenobiotics.

Models contamination‑like propagation in markets.

Uses hazard curves and decay models.

Integrates with Str‑Aux sampling.

2. Gaia System Integration

Cross‑domain translation layer.

Universal metrics for value or stress.

Transformation templates between economic systems.

Connector to external research graphs.

3. Eco‑Structural Models

General ecosystemic modules.

Symbol trophic‑level analogy.

Flow biomimicry for market drift.

4. Extended Risk Engine

Machine‑learning‑based risk scoring.

Continuity analysis with anomaly detection.

5. Scenario Simulator

What‑if explorer: mood, matrices, ledger reactions.

Deterministic or probabilistic pathways.

6. Long‑Range Analytics

Multi‑week decay windows.

Seasonality metrics.

Full‑spectrum tier dynamics.
