Purpose

A sandbox for deeper exploratory work that informs future modules, model refinements, and experimental layers. Not part of the production pipeline but serves as a conceptual backbone for long-term evolution.

1. Mathematical Foundations
Short‑Range Dynamics

Microstructure modeling from Str-Aux windows.

Statistical stability: variance clustering, rolling kurtosis.

Window concatenation heuristics.

Survival Analysis Threads

Hazard models applied to symbol stress probability.

Event‑trigger likelihood estimation from vector deltas.

Tier-transition modeling as state survival curves.

Matrix Aggregation

Weighting optimization.

Benchmark‑relative volatility envelopes.

GFM refinements.

2. Applied Research Threads
Ledger Reasoning

Multi‑path propagation for luggage.

Exposure lineage summarization.

Xenobiotic‑style Contamination Models (Transposed Concepts)

Using contaminant diffusion frameworks to model synchronized market dislocations.

Interdisciplinary Links

Toxicology kinetics → volatility decay functions.

Neuroscience network analogies → symbol dependency graphs.

3. Experimental Modules (Pending)

Stress‑prediction kernels for short‑term mood forecasting.

Symbol clustering via survival + microstructure similarity.

Adaptive thresholding for tier transitions.
