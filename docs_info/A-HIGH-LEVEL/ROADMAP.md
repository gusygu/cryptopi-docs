CryptoPi / CryptoPill – Public Roadmap (User-Oriented)

This roadmap is intentionally transparent and human-friendly. It describes where the platform is going, what is stable, what is experimental, and what the user can expect in the next iterations.

1. Current Stage — Foundational Alpha
What’s stable

Core matrices (pct24h, weight tiers)

Mood engine (early but interpretable)

Wallet tiers & readings

Session stamps + health smokes

What’s experimental

Flow signals (imprint/luggage)

Extended matrices (multi-interval)

Ingest optimizations

2. Near-Term Roadmap (1–3 weeks)
✓ Documentation Hub (UI)

A fully navigable documentation space inside the app.

✓ Tier Refinement

More clarity on how weight tiers and mood tiers form.

✓ Wallet Diagnostics

Adding simple visual guides for wallet risk & traction.

Scheduled

Symbol universe auto-sync

Improved sampler stability

Additional UI polish

3. Mid-Term Roadmap (1–2 months)
New Modules

Flow module refinements (clearer imprint/luggage UI)

Extended matrices: 6h, 12h, 48h contextualization

Wallet behavioural patterns

Quality of Life

Faster loading

Smoother transitions

More resilient background jobs

Invitation System

A controlled invitation-based entry system to onboard users gently.

4. Long-Term Roadmap (2–6 months)
Mood Atlas

A multi-symbol visual map of market sentiment.

Research Layer

Optional integration of specialized modules (e.g. toxicology, survival analysis) as part of the extended “guest ecosystem”.

Public Transparency Packs

Version-tagged doc packs with hashes, suitable for external anchoring.

5. Vision

CryptoPi is not meant to predict markets. It is meant to make markets readable.

The roadmap reflects a commitment to clarity, interpretability, and a respectful pace of development—every module must earn its presence in the interface.
