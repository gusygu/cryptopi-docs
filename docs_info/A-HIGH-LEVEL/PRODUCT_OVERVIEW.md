CryptoPi / CryptoPill — Product Overview
Purpose

CryptoPi is a modular, multi‑layer analytical engine designed to observe, evaluate, and contextualize crypto‑market dynamics through structured data ingestion, multi‑scale sampling, auxiliary signal computation, and a unified client interface. Its goal is not to predict markets, but to frame them — revealing structural behavior, sentiment patterns, windows of stability/instability, and portfolio‑level traction through a clean and disciplined architecture.

Core Ideas

Modularity: each domain is isolated into its own schema and logic (settings, market, matrices, str‑aux, cin‑aux, mea‑dynamics, wallet, ops).

Sampling Windows: market data is processed in deterministic windows (1m/5m/30m etc.), ensuring repeatability and comparability.

Auxiliary Engines: signal layers (str‑aux, cin‑aux, mea‑dynamics) transform raw data into interpretable states.

Tiers & Weights: matrices and mood engines establish weightings, momentum snapshots, and behavioral tiers.

Simplicity for End‑Users: the interface exposes only what is essential — clean matrices, wallet tiers, and flows.

Traceability: every run is timestamped and anchored through ops.session_log and hashable document packs.

What It Is Not

Not a trading bot.

Not a speculative signals provider.

Not an automated wealth optimizer.

CryptoPi is an observational instrument, similar in spirit to a astrophysical sensor array: it monitors, organizes, and reveals patterns that otherwise remain invisible.
